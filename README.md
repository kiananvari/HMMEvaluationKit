# HMM Evaluation Kit

Welcome to the HMMEvaluationKit repository! This repository is dedicated to providing a comprehensive toolkit for evaluating Hidden Markov Models (HMMs).


The HMMEvaluationKit is designed to assist researchers, data scientists, and enthusiasts in the evaluation and analysis of Hidden Markov Models. It includes implementations for calculating the probabilities of observations based on states and probabilities. This toolkit is particularly useful in various applications such as speech recognition, natural language processing, and bioinformatics.
